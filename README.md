## PedSimCity-Evaluation -  A workflow to evaluate the output of PedSimCity
 
This repository includes the necessary data and code to reproduce the analysis reported in *Modelling the effect of landmarks on pedestrian dynamics in urban environments*, published in *Computers, Environment and Urban Systems*.

The notebook *Modelling_Landmarks_Evaluation - London* can be used to evaluate the output of an ABM for pedestrian movement simulation, wherein landmarks are incorporated in the pedestrian agents' route choice models.
Such an ABM and the necessary input data are available [here](https://github.com/g-filomena/pedSimCity/tree/LandmarkBased).
Please note that the figures in the original paper were rendered in QGis, using the outputs of the jupyter notebook.

The notebooks *Urban_Subdivision_Evaluation - London* and *Urban_Subdivision_Evaluation - Paris* can be used to evaluate the output of an ABM for pedestrian movement simulation, wherein regions and barriers are incorporated in the pedestrian agents' route choice models.
Such an ABM and the necessary input data are available [here](https://github.com/g-filomena/pedSimCity/tree/RegionBased). 

The notebook *Urban_Subdivision_Evaluation - Plots* generates the figures presented in the paper *Perception of urban subdivisions in pedestrian movement simulation*, published in *PLOS ONE*.

The notebooks *EmpiricalABM_Clustering* and *EmpiricalABM_Evaluation* support the analysis described in the paper *Empirical characterisation of agentsâ€™ spatial behaviour in pedestrian movement simulation*, published in the *Journal of Environmental Psychlogy*. Here an empirical based agent based model for the simulation of pedestrian movement in cities is presented. 
Empirical data is employed to regulate the route choice behaviour of the agents, while allowing for heterogeneity in the agent population.

To run the jupyter notebooks you need to install the library [cityImage](https://github.com/g-filomena/cityImage) and its dependicies.
