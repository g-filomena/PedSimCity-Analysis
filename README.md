# PedSimCity_Analysis -  A workflow to analyse the output of PedSimCity
 
This repository includes the necessary data and code to reproduce the analysis reported in *Modelling the effect of landmarks on pedestrian dynamics in urban environments*, published in *Computers, Environment and Urban Systems*.

The notebook *Landmark_Navigation - London* was used to analyse the output of an ABM for pedestrian movement simulation, wherein landmarks are incorporated in the pedestrian agents' route choice models.
Such an ABM and the necessary input data are available [here](https://github.com/g-filomena/pedSimCity/tree/LandmarkBased) 

To run the jupyter notebook you need to install the library [cityImage]https://github.com/g-filomena/cityImage and its dependicies.
